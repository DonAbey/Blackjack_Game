# Blackjack_Game
This project is a complete text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python, featuring one player versus an automated dealer. The game uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to define the Deck and Player's hand, allowing players to bet, hit, stand, and manage their total money.
