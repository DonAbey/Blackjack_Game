# Blackjack Game

This project is a simple text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. The game allows a player to compete against an automated dealer, following the basic rules of Blackjack.

## Features

- **Deck of Cards**: A full deck of 52 cards is used, with suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs) and ranks (Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace).
- **Player vs Dealer**: The game supports one player playing against an automated dealer.
- **Game Actions**: The player can choose to "Hit" (draw a card) or "Stand" (end their turn).
- **Hand Value Calculation**: The game correctly calculates hand values, handling the Ace card as either 11 or 1 as appropriate.
- **Winner Determination**: The game determines the winner based on the hand values, including bust scenarios.

## How to Play

4. **Dealer's Turn**: The dealer draws cards until their hand value is at least 17.
5. **Determine Winner**: The game compares the hand values to determine the winner.
